Prussia, by far the largest and most important state in Germany, is governed by our party, in a coalition with the [? if not in_social_liberal_coalition_prussia: [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]?][? if not in_social_catholic_coalition_prussia:&nbsp;and [? if ddp_name == "DDP" and not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**Democratic**</span>?][? if ddp_name == "DStP" and not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**State**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**Liberal People's**</span>?] parties?]. It is the most stable and democratic state government in Germany, led by [? if prussia_leader == "Braun": the able Otto Braun?][? if prussia_leader == "Brüning": Heinrich Brüning?][? if prussia_leader == "Stegerwald": Adam Stegerwald?]. [? if prussia_leader != "Braun": Without Braun at the helm in Prussia, our pace of action has noticeably slowed. ?]

on-arrival: prussian_police_loyalty += 0.1

The police have historically been overrun with <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span>, and we are trying to change this, little by little. We have improved the training and recruitment process to select for a broader demographic than the traditional <span style="color: #3E88B3;">conservatives</span>, and to put a tighter leash on their political activity. In addition, we set up committees to investigate the ranks of the police and remove those with <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> sympathies. It is a slow and arduous work.

Current police loyalty: [+ prussian_police_loyalty : loyalty +].

@police_strength
on-arrival: prussian_police_strength += 20

We have increased the size of the Prussian police.

@bureaucracy

The bureaucracy is deeply <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span>, and many abuse their power to favor the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">political right</span>. By removing the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">pro-monarchy</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">pro-dictatorship</span> elements, we can democratize it. Some of our opponents claim that we are infringing on individual freedoms, but perhaps the security of the republic requires it.

Interior Minister Severing proposes expanding the Prussian police force to better maintain public order. Additional funding will allow for more recruitment, better training, and modern equipment for Prussia's finest.

As it turns out, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> has many allies in the police and bureaucracy. Our relationship with the police weakens, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> can still organize illegally, right under the police's noses. [? if sa_banned_pro : Nevertheless, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> is substantially weakened by our ban. ?] 

[? if coup_progress >= 6: There are reports of an imminent coup by the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>. We have disrupted some of these plans, but the threat is still present. ?]

on-arrival: sa_strength *= 0.97; sa_militancy -= 0.02; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.02; sa_strength *= 0.98 if prussian_police_loyalty >= 0.75

While an outright ban on the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> may be out of reach, we can make life as difficult as possible for the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Storm Troopers</span>. The most reckless among them can be prosecuted on charges of murder and related crimes, and we can ensure legal public demonstrations and meetings are protected from their unlawful disruptions.

[? if president == "Hindenburg": Banning the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> weakens our relationship with President Hindenburg, as well as the political <span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> and the police. ?][? if president != "Hindenburg": Banning the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> weakens our relationship with the political <span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> and the police. ?] [? if spd_in_government = 1 and in_grand_coalition = 1 and president = "Hindenburg" : It also weakens our coalition due to the influence of Hindenburg on the <span style="color: #C0A054;">right</span> wing of our coalition. ?] In addition, the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> still operates out of public sight.

The ban is enthusiastically carried out by the police, perhaps too enthusiastically. The <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span> take this as one more reason why the <span style="color: #c00000;">Socialists</span> are traitors to the <span style="color: #9B0000;">left</span>. However, the <span style="color: #000000;">moderate</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">center-right</span> parties approve, as do the police.

We have signed a Concordat between the Free State of Prussia and the Roman Catholic Church, guaranteeing religious freedom for Catholics in Prussia. This sets the stage for the negotiation of a national Concordat covering all of Germany.

[? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": The Catholic members of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> in Prussia are in open conflict with their leadership over the vote, with many leaving the party. ?]
